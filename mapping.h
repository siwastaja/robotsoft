Map unit is a 40mm*40mm area. Memory usage is carefully considered, because the world is a 2D map of the map units.

tight passages, which would be wasteful if the unit was larger) and memory/disk usage.

Map page is a fixed 256*256 * 40mm*40mm = 10.24m*10.24m area.

At all times, the following principles apply:
- There are 9 map pages (3*3) in the memory
- The robot is always located in the middle page.

To satisfy these conditions, map pages are stored/retrieved to/from the disk every time the robot crosses the map border.

/*
world_t is one continuously mappable entity. There can be several worlds, but the worlds cannot overlap;
in case they would, they should be combined.

When the software cannot decide which world it's in, we create a new, empty world. If we figure out it matches
an earlier world, we will combine them.

To make things simple, we statically allocate for the map page pointers. Map pages themselves are dynamically allocated.

256*256 map pages will limit the maximum world size to 2.62 km * 2.62 km. On a 64-bit system, storing pointers to map pages
and qmap pages, 1Mbyte is required for the pointers. NULL pointer means the data is not loaded in memory.
